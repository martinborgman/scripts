# image_build() should be called w/ the positional INPUT parameters below.

# Binary OS image build automation stub.
#   This script will build the OS image from a pre-built packages container.
#
# PREREQUISITES:
#
#   1. SDK version and OS image version are recorded in sdk_container/.repo/manifests/version.txt
#   2. Scripts repo version tag of OS image version to be built is available and checked out.
#   3. Flatcar packages container is available via build cache server
#       from "/containers/[VERSION]/flatcar-packages-[ARCH]-[FLATCAR_VERSION].tar.gz"
#       or present locally. Container must contain binary packages and torcx artefacts.
#
# INPUT:
#
#   1. Architecture (ARCH) of the TARGET OS image ("arm64", "amd64").
#
# OPTIONAL INPUT:
#
#   1. SIGNER. Environment variable. Name of the owner of the artifact signing key.
#        Defaults to nothing if not set - in such case, artifacts will not be signed.
#        If provided, SIGNING_KEY environment variable should also be provided, otherwise this environment variable will be ignored.
#
#   2. SIGNING_KEY. Environment variable. The artifact signing key.
#        Defaults to nothing if not set - in such case, artifacts will not be signed.
#        If provided, SIGNER environment variable should also be provided, otherwise this environment variable will be ignored.
#
# OUTPUT:
#
#   1. Exported container image with OS image, dev container, and related artifacts at
#        /home/sdk/image/[ARCH], torcx packages at /home/sdk/torcx
#        named "flatcar-images-[ARCH]-[FLATCAR_VERSION].tar.gz"
#        pushed to buildcache.
#   2. "./ci-cleanup.sh" with commands to clean up temporary build resources,
#        to be run after this step finishes / when this step is aborted.
#   3. If signer key was passed, signatures of artifacts from point 1, pushed along to buildcache.
